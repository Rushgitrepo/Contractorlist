We understand the technical needs dictated by the primary use of your floor (friction, shock absorption, vertical deformation, etc). We also understand the importance of aesthetics – a custom floor with your logo and team colors can inspire your athletes to greatness and intimidate visiting teams! We specialize in providing a customized gym floor that matches your school/corporate colors and the activities that you plan to conduct on the surface. The owners, with a long history in these and other specialty products, wanted to take their experience and create a service-based organization. The intent was to not only offer quality products at a competitive price, but to build a “reputation of excellence”. Over the past 20 years, that has remained the main focus of SSE.",
